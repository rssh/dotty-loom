## Dotty-Loom

  Proof of concept implementation of async/await over JDK Loom Continuations. 
   (see  https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/ for details)

### Usage

  For running this you should
    - switch to Loom JDK when
    - switch to Standard (Oracle/OpenVM)  JDK when compiling, because Loom JDK is crashed

 Note, that both Loom and Dotty are evolving, so this was work in some point of time in the past.
 No guarantees about current state.
